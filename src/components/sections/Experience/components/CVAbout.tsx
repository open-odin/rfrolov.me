              Engineer with a background that started in security and networks before moving fully into software. That path shaped how I think: I care about systems, not just interfaces — about what happens when things break, not just when they work.

              I build product-facing web applications with React and TypeScript. I&apos;ve shipped tools used by millions of students, dashboards for enterprise real estate clients, and full-stack projects in Go. I&apos;m drawn to work where the code connects to something real.
